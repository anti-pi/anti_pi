# 🛡️ Anti-Pi — Anti-Piracy Reporting Platform

## 🚀 Overview

Anti-Pi is a community-powered anti-piracy platform that rewards users for reporting piracy — from fake products to pirated software. Our goal is to make anti-piracy affordable, scalable, and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses that can't afford traditional solutions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> Piracy costs over ₹50,000 crore annually in India. Existing solutions are expensive, slow, and inaccessible to smaller brands. Everyday users are not incentivized to report piracy, resulting in poor data and limited action.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Anti-Pi introduces a crowdsourced platform where:
- Brands list products and set rewards
- Users report piracy and earn money
- Reports are verified for legitimacy
- Verified reports are sent to brands for action

This builds a scalable reporting ecosystem that’s fast, cheap, and community-driven.
